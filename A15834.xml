         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Hence alſo ariſeth that <hi>Ciuill order</hi> amongſt the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, which notwithſtanding the ſinnes of men, God hath beene very carefull to preſerue and keepe; and therefore hath his Deputies and Lieutenants vpon the earth, and vnder them ſubordinate rulers and gouernours, who haue the adminiſtration of Iuſtice and Iudgement.

But this wil appeare to be but a vaine ſurmiſe, for though <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> liued 600. yeeres, yet hee liued not to the dayes of <hi>Iacob</hi> by ten yeeres: and <hi>Iacob</hi> being at this time an 100. yeeres of age, it is not like, that <hi>Thamar</hi> being of <hi>Sem,</hi> or <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> ſhould be now child bearing.

                  <p>Now concerning this payre, thus met in this action, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers points are to be conſidered.
<note place="margin">1. Iudah.</note> Firſt, that <hi>Iudah</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen two of his ſonues in marriage to this <hi>Thamar, Er</hi> and <hi>Onan:</hi> the firſt of them beeing wicked in the ſight of the Lord, (and yet his wickedneſſe not expreſſed) therefore the Lord <hi>ſlew him;</hi> and by him ſhee had no iſſue. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he gaue his ſecond ſonne <hi>Onan</hi> vnto her, that he might raiſe vp ſeede vnto his brother; which order was for the continuance and preſeruation of the ſtocke and Familie; and ſo the child begotten of the ſecond brother ſhould haue the name and inheritance of the firſt; which wee know was afterward confirmed by <hi>Moſes:
<note place="margin">Deut. 25.1.</note> Hic mos fuit, crimen non fuit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> to vſe the words of Saint <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> this was then the manner, it was not holden for any fault.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iudah</hi> hauing thus loſt two of his ſonnes he diſſembles with <hi>Thamar</hi> concerning the third, and here was the ground of all the future miſchiefe: he wils her to remaine a Widdow till his third ſonne <hi>Shelah</hi> were growne vp, and yet had no purpoſe to giue <hi>Shelah</hi> vnto her:

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21280:18"/>as well as his other brethren, (for he ſuppoſed her to bee the only cauſe of the death of his other two ſonnes.) Now this ſeemes to aggrauate <hi>Iudahs</hi> ſinne, who perſwades her to remaine a Widdow in hope of <hi>Shelah,</hi> and yet had no purpoſe to giue <hi>Shelah</hi> vnto her. So you ſee, all is not right with <hi>Iudah</hi> here at the very firſt.</p>
                  <p>Come we neerer to the matter it ſelfe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is a ſaying fathered vpon Father <hi>Auguſtine: Malum eſt mulierem videre, peius alloqui, peſsimum tangere.</hi> It is ill enough to <hi>looke</hi> vpon a woman, worſe to <hi>talke</hi> with her,

And as <hi>Caeſar</hi> abridged the manner of his victories ouer <hi>Egypt,</hi> in three words, <hi>Venit, vidit, vicit;</hi> He came, he ſaw, he ouercame; So in three words, <hi>Iudah</hi> huddles vp his bargaine with this Cananitiſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to come more neere to the matter it ſelfe. The fact thus committed with <hi>Thamar,</hi> he labours to conceale it as much as he can. For when he had ſent the <hi>Kid,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the <hi>Pledge,</hi> and the Meſſenger could not finde her, he ſatisfies himſelfe without further inquirie, <hi>Accipiat ſibi,</hi> Let her take it, ſaith he, without more adoe, <hi>ne forte ſimus contemptui,</hi> leſt if al come to light we be aſhamed. Thus he feares man more then the God of Heauen that made man; and the ſhame of men he ſtands in more awe of, then the dreadfull preſence and Maieſtie of God. The credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his name, he preſerues, prefers, <hi>Omnia ſi perdat,</hi> if hee loſe all, yea euen God himſelfe, who is all in all;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21280:19"/>yet will he not incurre ſhame and reproch at the hands of men; as if God did ſhut vp his eyes in boxes, and were in a deepe ſlumber, as if his all-ſeeing eye were not preſent, yea, euen with them who would auoide his preſence; as if he tooke no account of mans iniquitie, or that the holy One of Iſrael would not be reuenged.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to lay open the wound yet more.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> You heard before how he was ouer-borne with luſt, with inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie; you ſhall now ſee him as farre ouer-gone with crueltie. I note it the rather, becauſe they are vices which ſeldome doe abandon one another, eſpecially if it be true, which ſome hold for a <hi>Maxime: Euery voluptuous Prince is cruell;</hi> and the more, if neceſſitie conſtraine him: as here this <hi>great man, Iudah</hi> adiudgeth <hi>Thamar</hi> for this fact to be burnt; not for any ſuch reaſon I rendred before, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he thought to be rid of <hi>Thamar,</hi> and ſo his ſonne <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> might be at liberty to marry elſewhere. For no doubt had not this beene his purpoſe, he would not haue beene ſo forward, ſo reſolute. He would rather haue expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her concerning the Fact; For was there no order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding to be had? Doth hee ſettle his Iudgement vpon the firſt impreſſion to haue her diſpatched? Had ſhe been married to two of his ſonnes, <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan;</hi> and is his fauor no better, nay are his words ſo bitter, the words of death? Surely yea: here is but a word and a blowe. As peremptorie was he, as euer was <hi>Dauid;

Nay, here is one thing more, that fils vp the meaſure of his iniquitie, and makes him wicked aboue meaſure; for hee would haue had her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched being great with child.

<note place="margin">2.

                     <note place="margin">2. Thamar.</note> if we pull off her vaile, we may eaſily ſee, that though it couered her face, yet it could not couer her ſinne.

And ſay ſhe did it not in any deſire of inordinate luſt, as it is like ſhe did not, but rather <hi>ſucceſſionis gratia,</hi> deſiring onely to haue iſſue: <hi>Et ex ea familia quam delegerat,</hi> and of that Family and I ribe too that ſhee had choſen.

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> was not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed: I ſay though her intention was neuer ſo good, yet doth it not make the action good. For it is not enough for a man to propound a good end, but the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is to accompliſh it muſt be alſo good. The procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, a thing lawfull to be deſired, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God goeth along in the vigour and ſtrength of it, and God hath ſet downe a lawful order for the ſame, and that the generation of mankinde ſhould runne in a right courſe; therefore it is wicked and abominable, by vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to ſeeke to compaſſe it:

                  <p>Againe, I doubt not but <hi>Thamar</hi> ſinned euen againſt her conſcience: For ſhe knew ſhee did not well to put off her widdowes garment, and to diſguiſe her ſelfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21280:21"/>he would keepe vs from theſe ſinnes; our Families, our Cities, our Nation. For though God through his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prouidence can turne euill into good, and out of euill can produce good, as here of <hi>Iudahs</hi> inceſt with <hi>Thamar,</hi> vvho begat <hi>Phares,</hi> and <hi>Phares, Eſrom,</hi> and <hi>Eſrom, Aram;</hi> and ſo ye know the period of that line, Chriſt: Yet where theſe ſins are committed, there can nothing be expected, but the dreadfull vengeance of God to bee powred out. And though we finde in Scripture, as one well obſerueth,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Muſculus ſuper Gen. cap.</hi> 19.</note> that many vertuous women, accompanying with their husbands were barren, or at moſt, hardly conceiued; as <hi>Sara, Rebecca, Rahel, Anna:</hi> Contrariwiſe diuers others, ſaith he, <hi>vno illegitimo concubitu conceperunt,</hi> as <hi>Bethſheba</hi> with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and here <hi>Thamar</hi> with <hi>Iudah;</hi> and not onely <hi>vno,</hi> but <hi>primo,</hi> as <hi>Lots</hi> daughters being virgins, with their owne father: I ſay, though this comes to paſſe, yet doth it not argue, that God (vvho in this caſe bleſſeth nature, as it is his worke, and not the vnlawfull action of the vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,) fauoureth theſe vnlawfull commixtures any vvhit the more, but it ſhewes rather, that he will reueale, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and bring ſuch ſecret wickedneſſe to light, vvhich to the vvicked and vnrepentant, vvorkes confuſion: to them, in whom the remainders of grace are not wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and vvhom God hath a purpoſe to reclaime, it vvorkes their conuerſion, and amendment of their naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie life; as in <hi>Dauid</hi> was moſt apparent, and here in <hi>Iudah</hi> remaineth to be proued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The whole Scripture</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is giuen by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and is profitable to teach and to inſtruct;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to lay open mans frailtie, and the infirmitie of his Nature; yea, euen of thoſe <hi>Grand-fathers,</hi> the Beaupeeres of the world. Often wee finde in Scripture, men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place, of great imployment, of ſpeciall fauour vvith God, yet haue fallen very dangerouſly; as here <hi>Iudah</hi> into <hi>Inceſt</hi> with his daughter in Law;

                  <p>A ſecond reaſon vvhy the <hi>Inceſt</hi> of theſe two is related,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is this: yee know the manner of the Iew vvas much to boaſt of his pedigree and deſcent;

                     <hi>Nil niſi Cecropides,</hi> I tell you he vvill be noble or nothing. In the 8. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> they told Chriſt to his face, that <hi>they were not the children of fornication:</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the report of <hi>Iudahs Inceſt</hi> was yet for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe more then all the reſt. Wee know that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:21280:22"/>came of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and in that golden Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in the Goſpell.
